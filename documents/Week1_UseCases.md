# Use Cases

For this project I would like to propose the following use cases:

1. As a user I can import a transcipt from a customer interview (*.txt) so the application can clean it. I should be able to:
- input a name for the study 
- store study name to database for future retrieval
2. As a user I can see an un-processed form of the file contents so I can verify that it has been accurately read in
- get and store file name
- store file name for future retrieval
3. As a user I can clean the dialog text, including:
- remove unwanted newlines and numbers
- remove timestamps
- extract all speaker names in the dialog
- display cleaned dialog 
4. As a user I can save cleaned text for future retrieval
- output the cleaner version to a new txt file specified by user
- save cleaner version to database for future retrieval
